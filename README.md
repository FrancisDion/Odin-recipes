Odin-recipes
This mini project will only use simple html and make us practice those new skills we have learned.

We will use;
Herders from h1 to h6 (might not use them all),
Organized and unorganized list,
make some text bold or italic,
add links and some images.

This site will have few fictional recipes displayed. Will maybe add some css to it later.
